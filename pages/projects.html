          NEXT COMPETITION DESIGN <br />
        </div>
        <div class="blurb">
          Entered in Steelcase’s annual ‘Next’ competition, this project’s footprint was determined and the
          rules were set. The ambition was for that of an innovative office design for the hypothetical Real
          Estate company, “Next” housed in Boston, MA. The goal was to create the most versatile
          contemporary office space while strictly using Steelcase + associated companies’ products.
          While the building’s shell was provided in Revit for the designers, the depth of the project
          allowed for independent creativity and innovation. Studying current trends and styles within the
          office design world brought with it a notion of versatility and change- thus informing my core
          theme of ‘transparency’ within the design. Using two separated suites, defining and uniting the
          areas required purpose and a sense of flow. Ultimately, the project came to bring a strong
          sense of transparency, allowing for the layout to speak for its functional needs, and allowing
          those passing by to gaze upon the showcased collaborative spaces. These choices spoke
          largely for the diversity and pride of the company, and encouraged connection with the public. <br /><br />

          Using the shell of New Era’s flagship location, in downtown Buffalo, and allowing for the first two
          floors to house the retail flagship, the Women’s Center was created upon the third floor. <br /> In
          collaboration with two fellow peers,  and adopting the Western New York Women’s foundation as
          a desired end user- the scope was understood. <br />
          The project developed into a multi-function cultural hub for empowering women. <br />The design
          featured administrative areas for the foundation, rent-able incubator space, and a youth center.
          Yet the most exciting piece of this design was housed at the heart of the project. An enormous
          multi-elevation ramp unifies the public and provides in its form both an elevated cafe space and
          contrasting sunkin lecture pit. The innovation of connection within this design, earned it both a
          spot in the Dean’s Gallery of Arts + Sciences as well as the deserved title ‘Interconnected’.<br />

          THG - CINEMATIC SPACES CD SET <br />
          <div class="blurb">
            Inspired from a student’s choice television show or movie this construction document set began
            as a re-creation of a cinematic spaces’ floor plan. Upon a deeper understanding of core values
            within the design of each student’s cinematic space small groups of students were define and
            tasked with bringing their design values into a new space. Groups were selected based on
            compatibility of their media and teams were tasked with relating their subject matter both to one
            another’s topics and their new location- The Buffalo State College Alumni Center. This project’s
            group combined values from the television shows Sherlock, and The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,
            and the film Lilo + Stitch. The interior was then tasked with housing a bar, a cafe, and a lounge
            in any organization the groups saw fit. Upon the completion of this phase, the groups moved
            into creating detailed drafting documents to showcase the exact construction instructions for any
            and all built-ins and various other items with questionable implementation. The result was a
            multi-level complex set of construction documents for the BSC Alumni Center. <br /><br />
