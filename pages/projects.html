          NEXT COMPETITION DESIGN <br />

            Entered in Steelcase’s annual ‘Next’ competition, this project’s footprint was determined and the
            rules were set. The ambition was for that of an innovative office design for the hypothetical Real
            Estate company, “Next” housed in Boston, MA. The goal was to create the most versatile
            contemporary office space while strictly using Steelcase + associated companies’ products.
            While the building’s shell was provided in Revit for the designers, the depth of the project
            allowed for independent creativity and innovation. Studying current trends and styles within the
            office design world brought with it a notion of versatility and change- thus informing my core
            theme of ‘transparency’ within the design. Using two separated suites, defining and uniting the
            areas required purpose and a sense of flow. Ultimately, the project came to bring a strong
            sense of transparency, allowing for the layout to speak for its functional needs, and allowing
            those passing by to gaze upon the showcased collaborative spaces. These choices spoke
            largely for the diversity and pride of the company, and encouraged connection with the public.

            Using the shell of New Era’s flagship location, in downtown Buffalo, and allowing for the first two
            floors to house the retail flagship, the Women’s Center was created upon the third floor. In
            collaboration with two fellow peers,  and adopting the Western New York Women’s foundation as
            a desired end user- the scope was understood. <br />
            The project developed into a multi-function cultural hub for empowering women. The design
            featured administrative areas for the foundation, rent-able incubator space, and a youth center.
            Yet the most exciting piece of this design was housed at the heart of the project. An enormous
            multi-elevation ramp unifies the public and provides in its form both an elevated cafe space and
            contrasting sunkin lecture pit. The innovation of connection within this design, earned it both a
            spot in the Dean’s Gallery of Arts + Sciences as well as the deserved title ‘Interconnected’.<br />
